# Multi Layer Perceptron - Optical Character Recognition

### Multilayer Perceptron:
Extending the perceptron to the multilayer perceptron (MLP) simply introduces a intermediate preceptrons (layers) before reading the output and generalizes the step function to a broader class of functions called activation functions.

### Feed forward
Given a predefined neural network architecture (the architecture of a neural network refers to all the elements necessary to completely define the flow of data, which involve the number and size of hidden layers, which activation functions, the output size, etc.) the process of generating an output from an input is called a forward pass.
